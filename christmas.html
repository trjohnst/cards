          <p>On a winter night, the weather was fair</p>
          <p>the smell of Christmas trees, twas in the air</p>
          <p>Justin wondered aloud, "Is Santa a myth?"</p>
          <p>Tommy paused from drinking the fifth</p>

          <p>"A quest for truth, this is indeed,</p>
          <p>Let us embark with the greatest speed"</p>
          <p>And to this response, Justin's smile widened</p>
          <p>Both their excitements seemed to be heightened</p>

        <section>
          <p>"We shall prepare a trap", Tommy exclaimed</p>
          <p>"One which won't leave Santa too horribly maimed"</p>
          <p>The two toiled with cookies and barbed wire</p>
          <p>Late unto the night, until they grew tired</p>

          <p>But then in the morning, a loud noise awoke them</p>
          <p>"He's here, he's here", Justin had spoken</p>
          <p>The boys ran downstairs, with a pip in their step</p>
          <p>To see Santa sprawled out, caught in a net</p>

          <p>Santa wailed in pain "SHIT!" </p>
          <p>"Get me out or I'll throw a big fit"</p>
          <p>The boys loosened the trap, letting Santa out</p>
          <p>The legend stood up and began to pout</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p>"Now Santa, look here" Justin schooled</p>
          <p>"You can't do that with all of your rules"</p>
          <p>"When stifled are kids, cursedly bad tempered"</p>
          <p>"All due to promises of presents rendered"</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p>"I can do whatever I like", Santa retorted</p>
          <p>"I'm *&$#ing Santa" he spat out, then departed</p>
          <p>"Well there you have it" Justin admired</p>
          <p>"Santa is real, he's just kind of a dick"</p>
